  abstract =      {Complex networks are studied across many fields of
                   science. To uncover their structural design
                   principles, we defined "network motifs," patterns of
                   interconnections occurring in complex networks at
                   numbers that are significantly higher than those in
                   randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks
                   from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and
                   engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food
                   webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the
                   genetic networks of Escherichia coli and
                   Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the
                   World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks
                   that perform information processing, even though they
                   describe elements as different as biomolecules within
                   a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in
                   Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define
                   universal classes of networks. This approach may
                   uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

                   the extraction of information from physics
                   experiments even in ill-conditioned circumstances.
                   The approach provides a unified rationale for data
                   analysis, which both justifies many of the commonly
                   used analysis procedures and reveals some of the
                   implicit underlying assumptions. This review
                   summarizes the general ideas of the Bayesian
                   probability theory with emphasis on the application
                   to the evaluation of experimental data. As case
                   studies for Bayesian parameter estimation techniques
                   examples ranging from extra-solar planet detection to
                   the deconvolution of the apparatus functions for
                   improving the energy resolution and change point
                   estimation in time series are discussed. Special
                   attention is paid to the numerical techniques suited
                   for Bayesian analysis, with a focus on recent
                   developments of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms
                   for high-dimensional integration problems. Bayesian
                   model comparison, the quantitative ranking of models
                   for the explanation of a given data set, is
                   illustrated with examples collected from cosmology,
                   mass spectroscopy, and surface physics, covering
                   problems such as background subtraction and automated
                   outlier detection. Additionally the Bayesian
                   inference techniques for the design and optimization
                   of future experiments are introduced. Experiments,
                   instead of being merely passive recording devices,
                   can now be designed to adapt to measured data and to
                   change the measurement strategy on the fly to
                   maximize the information of an experiment. The
                   applied key concepts and necessary numerical tools
                   which provide the means of designing such inference
                   chains and the crucial aspects of data fusion are

                   interconnected dynamical units. The first approach to

                   model them as graphs whose nodes represent the
                   dynamical units, and whose links stand for the
                   interactions between them. On the one hand,

                   as metabolism, signalling and development) and
                   control important aspects of cell physiology, such as
                   circadian rhythms, DNA synthesis, mitosis and the
                   development of somites in vertebrate embryos (TABLE
                   1). In the 1950s and 1960s, the first clear examples
                   of biochemical oscillations (in metabolic systems)
                   were recognized in glycolysis 1,2 , cyclic AMP
                   production 3 and the horseradish peroxidase reaction
                   4,5. Soon after these discoveries were made,
                   theo-reticians were thinking about the general
                   requirements for chemical oscillations and the
                   specific mechanisms of these examples 6,7. After the
                   molecular biology revolution of the 1980s, many new
                   examples of oscillations in protein interaction
                   networks (PINs) and in gene-regulatory networks
                   (GRNs) came to light, such as the period (PER)
                   proteins in animal circadian control 8 , the cyclin
                   proteins in eukaryotic cell-cycle control 9,10 and
                   the repressilator 11 in genetically engineered
                   bacteria. Understanding the molecular basis of
                   cellular oscillations is more than an exercise in
                   experimental genetics and biochemistry. Oscillators
                   have systems-level characteristics (for example,
                   periodicity, robustness and entrainment) that
                   transcend the properties of individual molecules or
                   reaction partners and that involve the full topology
                   of the reaction network. These properties can only be
                   fully understood by viewing experimental data from a
                   theoretical perspective and by quantitative
                   mathematical modelling of chemical oscillatory
                   processes. These models address general concepts of
                   dynamical systems, such as feedback, time delays,
                   bistability and hysteresis. In this review, we
                   present a series of examples of increasing complexity
                   that illustrate the essential requirements for
                   biochemical oscillators. First, negative feedback is
                   necessary to carry a reaction network back to the
                   'starting point' of its oscillation. Second, the
                   negative-feedback signal must be sufficiently delayed
                   in time so that the chemical reactions do not settle
                   on a stable steady state. Third, the kinetic rate
                   laws of the reaction mechanism must be sufficiently
                   'nonlinear' to destabilize the steady state. Fourth,
                   the reactions that produce and consume the
                   interacting chemical species must occur on
                   appropriate timescales that permit the network to
                   generate oscillations. Time delay can be created by a
                   physical constraint (for example, the minimal time
                   necessary to carry out transcription and translation,
                   or the time needed to transport chemical species
                   between cellular compartments), by a long chain of
                   reaction intermediates (as in a metabolic pathway) or
                   by dynamical hysteresis (overshoot and undershoot, as
                   consequences of positive feedback in the reaction
                   mechanism). To keep the mathematical details of
                   oscillating chemical reactions to a minimum, we will
                   demonstrate the design principles of biochemical
                   oscillators by rate plots (which show how reaction
                   rates depend on chemical concentrations),
                   signal-response curves (which show how oscillations
                   turn on and off in response to regulatory signals)
                   and 'constraint' diagrams (which show how the kinetic
                   constants of a reaction mechanism are constrained by
                   requirements for periodicity). The mathematics are
                   available to interested readers in Supplementary
                   information S1-S4 (boxes). For further details on the
                   principles that underlie chemical and biochemical
                   oscillations, we refer readers to books 12-15 and
                   review articles 2,6,16-18. Somites Early

                   are laid down in a temporally and spatially periodic
                   pattern. Robustness The notion that a control system
                   should function reliably in the face of expected
                   perturbations from outside the control system and
                   from inevitable internal fluctuations. Abstract |
                   Cellular rhythms are generated by complex
                   interactions among genes, proteins and metabolites.
                   They are used to control every aspect of cell
                   physiology, from signalling, motility and development
                   to growth, division and death. We consider specific
                   examples of oscillatory processes and discuss four
                   general requirements for biochemical oscillations:
                   negative feedback, time delay, sufficient
                   'nonlinearity' of the reaction kinetics and proper
                   balancing of the timescales of opposing chemical
                   reactions. Positive feedback is one mechanism to
                   delay the negative-feedback signal. Biological
                   oscillators can be classified according to the
                   topology of the positive-and negative-feedback loops

  abstract =      {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte
                   Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk
                   behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters
                   that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of
                   steps informed by first-order gradient information.
                   These features allow it to converge to
                   high-dimensional target distributions much more
                   quickly than simpler methods such as random walk
                   Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's
                   performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified
                   parameters: a step size \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\}
                   and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L
                   is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable
                   random walk behavior, while if L is too large the
                   algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the
                   No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that
                   eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS
                   uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely
                   candidate points that spans a wide swath of the
                   target distribution, stopping automatically when it
                   starts to double back and retrace its steps.
                   Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as
                   and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned
                   standard HMC method, without requiring user
                   intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a
                   method for adapting the step size parameter
                   \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} on the fly based on
                   primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no
                   hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for
                   applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference
                   engines that require efficient turnkey sampling
                   algorithms.},

                   first experimental realization of an enzymatic
                   reaction network capable of an adaptive response is
                   reported. The design is based on the dual activity of
                   trypsin, which activates chymotrypsin while at the
                   same time generating a fluorescent output from a
                   fluorogenic substrate. Once activated, chymotrypsin
                   counteracts the trypsin output by competing for the
                   fluorogenic substrate and producing a non-fluorescent
                   output. It is demonstrated that this network produces
                   a transient fluorescent output under
                   out-of-equilibrium conditions while the input signal
                   persists. Importantly, in agreement with mathematical
                   simulations, we show that optimization of the
                   pulse-like response is an inherent trade-off between
                   maximum amplitude and lowest residual fluorescence.},

                   250 years, widespread application of the Bayesian
                   approach only began in statistics in 1990. By 2000,
                   Bayesian statistics had made considerable headway
                   into social science, but even now its direct use is
                   rare in articles in top sociology journals, perhaps
                   because of a lack of knowledge about the topic. In
                   this review, we provide an overview of the key ideas
                   and terminology of Bayesian statistics, and we
                   discuss articles in the top journals that have used
                   or developed Bayesian methods over the last decade.
                   In this process, we elucidate some of the advantages
                   of the Bayesian approach. We highlight that many
                   sociologists are, in fact, using Bayesian methods,
                   even if they do not realize it, because techniques
                   deployed by popular software packages often involve
                   Bayesian logic and/or computation. Finally, we
                   conclude by briefly discussing the future of Bayesian

                   biological responses when subjected to biochemical
                   stimuli. It has become apparent that these biological
                   responses are regulated by complex chemical reaction
                   networks (CRNs). Unravelling the function of these
                   circuits is a key topic of both systems biology and
                   synthetic biology. Recent progress at the interface
                   of chemistry and biology together with the
                   realisation that current experimental tools are
                   insufficient to quantitatively understand the

                   triggered renewed interest in the bottom-up
                   development of CRNs. This builds upon earlier work of
                   physical chemists who extensively studied inorganic
                   CRNs and showed how a system of chemical reactions
                   can give rise to complex spatiotemporal responses
                   such as oscillations and pattern formation. Using
                   purified biochemical components, in vitro synthetic
                   biologists have started to engineer simplified model
                   systems with the goal of mimicking biological
                   responses of intracellular circuits. Emulation and
                   reconstruction of system-level properties of
                   intracellular networks using simplified circuits are

                   programs that underlie the biological function of

                   accessible overview of this emerging field starting
                   with key studies on inorganic CRNs followed by a
                   discussion of recent work involving purified
                   biochemical components. Finally, we review recent

                   chemical framework. Living systems rely on complex
                   networks of chemical reactions to control the

                   behaviour under aqueous conditions (such as
                   supramolecular hydrogels composed of self-assembled
                   nanofibres) have many potential biological
                   applications. However, designing a macroscopic
                   response to structurally complex biochemical stimuli
                   in these materials still remains a challenge. Here we
                   show that redox-responsive peptide-based hydrogels
                   have the ability to encapsulate enzymes and still
                   retain their activities. Moreover, cooperative
                   coupling of enzymatic reactions with the gel response
                   enables us to construct unique stimuli-responsive
                   soft materials capable of sensing a variety of
                   disease-related biomarkers. The programmable gel-sol
                   response (even to biological samples) is visible to
                   the naked eye. Furthermore, we built Boolean logic
                   gates (OR and AND) into the hydrogel-enzyme hybrid
                   materials, which were able to sense simultaneously
                   plural specific biochemicals and execute a controlled
                   drug release in accordance with the logic operation.
                   The intelligent soft materials that we have developed
                   may prove valuable in future medical diagnostics or
                   treatments. T here has been a growing interest in
                   soft matter 1 , the macro-scopic structure and
                   physical properties of which undergo detectable
                   changes in response to external stimuli.
                   Particularly, soft materials with the ability to
                   function under aqueous conditions, such as hydrogels,
                   are attractive because of their potential
                   applications in bioassays 2 , controlled drug release
                   3,4 and regenerative medicine 5. The majority of
                   stimuli-responsive hydrogels developed to date
                   respond to simple physical or chemical stimuli 2-6.
                   In sharp contrast, living systems use diverse
                   structurally complex biochemical stimuli to maintain
                   homeostasis 7,8. These bio-chemicals are regarded as
                   indicators of health status (for example, D-glucose
                   in diabetes 9) and thus as biomarkers 10-12. Although
                   soft materials with the ability to sense biomarkers
                   selectively and respond appropriately are highly
                   desirable, the extraordinary diversity and structural
                   complexity of biomarkers has impeded the rational
                   design and synthesis of stimuli-responsive materials.
                   Recently, supramolecular hydrogels composed of
                   self-assembled small molecules (hydrogelators) and
                   large amounts of water (typi-cally over 99{\%}) have
                   emerged 13-17. Various biological applications of
                   supramolecular hydrogels, which include bioassays
                   18-21 and regenerative medicine 22-24 , have been
                   actively explored. In such hydrogels, small
                   structural changes of hydrogelators induced by
                   stimuli are amplified to bring about macroscopic
                   gel-sol phase transitions. This property has been
                   exploited to design programmable materials based on
                   the elaborate chemical synthesis of the
                   hydroge-lators. However, the majority of
                   chemical-stimuli responsive supra-molecular hydrogels
                   reported so far have the limitation of being able to
                   respond only to structurally simple chemical stimuli
                   such as pH 22,25,26 , cations (or ionic strength)
                   23,24,27,28 or anions 27,29. This is ascribed mainly
                   to the fact that, so far, most biochemicals are too
                   complex for synthetic chemists to prepare small
                   molecular scaffolds capable of selectively
                   recognizing and sensing them. For biochemical
                   stimuli, supramolecular hydrogels responsive to
                   ligand-receptor binding 30,31 or enzyme activities
                   32-34 have been developed. However, these examples
                   exploited the peptide-based hydrogelators themselves
                   as a ligand for the receptor or the enzyme
                   substrates, which thereby demanded elaborate design
                   and synthesis of specialized hydrogelator molecules.
                   Very recently, several groups, including us 35 , have
                   focused on the redox-controlled self-assembly of
                   rather simple hydrogelators 36-38. Based on these
                   gelators, we report here a new and simple strategy
                   for constructing, without tedious synthetic effort,
                   supramolecular hydrogels responsive to a variety of
                   structurally complex biochemical stimuli. Using
                   hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2)-responsive hydrogels 35
                   as a universal matrix, it was demonstrated that
                   programmable hybridization of hydrogels with oxidases
                   enables these materials to respond to input stimuli
                   ranging from simple H 2 O 2 molecules to a variety of
                   disease-related biomarkers, which include glucose,
                   lactose, uric acid, choline, acetylcholine and
                   sarcosine. Also, the hybrid hydrogel was demonstrated
                   to respond to the higher glucose content in samples
                   of human blood plasma. This strategy was validated
                   further by developing a second hydrogel type that is
                   responsive to physiological reducing agents such as
                   NADH and lactic acid. Additionally, into these
                   supramolecular hydrogels we were able to build
                   successfully OR and AND logic-gate responses towards
                   several biochemicals. The soft materials we developed
                   here allowed us not only to detect the presence of
                   various bio-markers in solution with the naked eye,
                   but also to regulate logically the release of
                   therapeutic antibodies. These intelligent hybrid
                   hydro-gels can be expected to be suitable platforms
                   for the development of advanced soft materials for
                   the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases,
                   including diabetes, gout and cancer.},

                   based on biological knowledge. However, such
                   knowledge is typically restricted. Wrongly modelled
                   biological mechanisms as well as relevant external
                   influence factors that are not included into the
                   model are likely to manifest in major discrepancies
                   between model predictions and experimental data.
                   Finding the exact reasons for such observed
                   discrepancies can be quite challenging in practice.
                   In order to address this issue, we suggest a Bayesian
                   approach to estimate hidden influences in ODE-based
                   models. The method can distinguish between exogenous
                   and endogenous hidden influences. Thus, we can detect
                   wrongly specified as well as missed molecular
                   interactions in the model. We demonstrate the
                   performance of our Bayesian dynamic elastic-net with
                   several ordinary differential equation models from
                   the literature, such as human JAK–STAT signalling,
                   information processing at the erythropoietin
                   receptor, isomerization of liquid $\alpha$ -Pinene, G
                   protein cycling in yeast and UV-B triggered
                   signalling in plants. Moreover, we investigate a set
                   of commonly known network motifs and a
                   gene-regulatory network. Altogether our method
                   supports the modeller in an algorithmic manner to
                   identify possible sources of errors in ODE-based

                   biological systems is the determination of the model
                   parameters. Typically, only a fraction of the
                   parameters (such as kinetic rate constants) are
                   experimentally measured, while the rest are often
                   fitted. The fitting process is usually based on
                   experimental time course measurements of observables,
                   which are used to assign parameter values that
                   minimize some measure of the error between these
                   measurements and the corresponding model prediction.
                   The measurements, which can come from immunoblotting
                   assays, fluorescent markers, etc., tend to be very
                   noisy and taken at a limited number of time points.
                   In this work we present a new approach to the problem
                   of parameter selection of biological models. We show
                   how one can use a dynamic recursive estimator, known
                   as extended Kalman filter, to arrive at estimates of
                   the model parameters. The proposed method follows.
                   First, we use a variation of the Kalman filter that
                   is particularly well suited to biological
                   applications to obtain a first guess for the unknown
                   parameters. Secondly, we employ an a posteriori
                   identifiability test to check the reliability of the
                   estimates. Finally, we solve an optimization problem
                   to refine the first guess in case it should not be
                   accurate enough. The final estimates are guaranteed
                   to be statistically consistent with the measurements.
                   Furthermore, we show how the same tools can be used
                   to discriminate among alternate models of the same
                   biological process. We demonstrate these ideas by
                   applying our methods to two examples, namely a model
                   of the heat shock response in E. coli, and a model of
                   a synthetic gene regulation system. The methods
                   presented are quite general and may be applied to a
                   wide class of biological systems where noisy
                   measurements are used for parameter estimation or
                   model selection.},

                   biological systems. When these models are fit to
                   data, it is necessary to ascertain the uncertainty in
                   the model fit. Here, we present prediction deviation,
                   a metric of uncertainty that determines the extent to
                   which observed data have constrained the model's
                   predictions. This is accomplished by solving an
                   optimization problem that searches for a pair of
                   models that each provides a good fit for the observed
                   data, yet has maximally different predictions. We
                   develop a method for estimating a priori the impact
                   that additional experiments would have on the
                   prediction deviation, allowing the experimenter to
                   design a set of experiments that would most reduce
                   uncertainty. We use prediction deviation to assess
                   uncertainty in a model of interferon-alpha inhibition
                   of viral infection, and to select a sequence of
                   experiments that reduces this uncertainty. Finally,
                   we prove a theoretical result which shows that
                   prediction deviation provides bounds on the
                   trajectories of the underlying true model. These

                   eukaryotes, typically consisting of a set of
                   first-order nonlinear ordinary differential
                   equations, have become increasingly popular of late.
                   These systems have large numbers of poorly known
                   parameters, simplified dynamics, and uncertain
                   connectivity: three key features of a class of
                   problems we call sloppy models, which are shared by
                   many other high-dimensional multiparameter nonlinear
                   models. We use a statistical ensemble method to study
                   the behavior of these models, in order to extract as
                   much useful predictive information as possible from a
                   sloppy model, given the available data used to
                   constrain it. We discuss numerical challenges that
                   emerge in using the ensemble method for a large
                   system. We characterize features of sloppy model
                   parameter fluctuations by various spectral
                   decompositions and find indeed that five parameters
                   can be used to fit an elephant. We also find that
                   model entropy is as important to the problem of model
                   choice as model energy is to parameter choice.},

  abstract =      {Background: Kinetic models of biochemical systems
                   usually consist of ordinary differential equations
                   that have many unknown parameters. Some of these
                   parameters are often practically unidentifiable, that
                   is, their values cannot be uniquely determined from
                   the available data. Possible causes are lack of
                   influence on the measured outputs, interdependence
                   among parameters, and poor data quality. Uncorrelated
                   parameters can be seen as the key tuning knobs of a
                   predictive model. Therefore, before attempting to
                   perform parameter estimation (model calibration) it
                   is important to characterize the subset(s) of
                   identifiable parameters and their interplay. Once
                   this is achieved, it is still necessary to perform
                   parameter estimation, which poses additional
                   challenges. Methods: We present a methodology that
                   (i) detects high-order relationships among
                   parameters, and (ii) visualizes the results to
                   facilitate further analysis. We use a collinearity
                   index to quantify the correlation between parameters
                   in a group in a computationally efficient way. Then
                   we apply integer optimization to find the largest
                   groups of uncorrelated parameters. We also use the
                   collinearity index to identify small groups of highly
                   correlated parameters. The results files can be
                   visualized using Cytoscape, showing the identifiable
                   and non-identifiable groups of parameters together
                   with the model structure in the same graph. Results:
                   Our contributions alleviate the difficulties that
                   appear at different stages of the identifiability
                   analysis and parameter estimation process. We show
                   how to combine global optimization and regularization
                   techniques for calibrating medium and large scale
                   biological models with moderate computation times.
                   Then we evaluate the practical identifiability of the
                   estimated parameters using the proposed methodology.
                   The identifiability analysis techniques are
                   implemented as a MATLAB toolbox called VisId, which
                   is freely available as open source from GitHub (
                   https://github.com/gabora/visid ). Conclusions: Our
                   approach is geared towards scalability. It enables
                   the practical identifiability analysis of dynamic
                   models of large size, and accelerates their
                   calibration. The visualization tool allows modellers
                   to detect parts that are problematic and need
                   refinement or reformulation, and provides
                   experimentalists with information that can be helpful
                   in the design of new experiments.},

  abstract =      {Reductionism, which has dominated biological research
                   for over a century, has provided a wealth of
                   knowledge about individual cellular components and
                   their functions. Despite its enormous success, it is
                   increasingly clear that a discrete biological
                   function can only rarely be attributed to an
                   individual molecule. Instead, most biological
                   characteristics arise from complex interactions
                   between the cell's numerous constituents, such as
                   proteins, DNA, RNA and small molecules 1-8.
                   Therefore, a key challenge for biology in the
                   twenty-first century is to understand the structure
                   and the dynamics of the complex intercellular web of
                   interactions that contribute to the structure and
                   function of a living cell. The development of
                   high-throughput data-collection techniques, as
                   epitomized by the widespread use of microarrays,
                   allows for the simultaneous interrogation of the
                   status of a cell's components at any given time. In
                   turn, new technology platforms, such as PROTEIN CHIPS
                   or semi-automated YEAST TWO-HYBRID SCREENS, help to
                   determine how and when these molecules interact with
                   each other. Various types of interaction webs, or
                   networks, (including protein-protein interaction,
                   metabolic, signalling and transcription-regulatory
                   networks) emerge from the sum of these interactions.
                   None of these networks are independent, instead they
                   form a 'network of networks' that is responsible for
                   the behaviour of the cell. A major challenge of
                   contemporary biology is to embark on an integrated
                   theoretical and experimental programme to map out,
                   understand and model in quan-tifiable terms the
                   topological and dynamic properties of the various
                   networks that control the behaviour of the cell. Help
                   along the way is provided by the rapidly developing
                   theory of complex networks that, in the past few
                   years, has made advances towards uncovering the
                   organizing principles that govern the formation and
                   evolution of various complex technological and social
                   networks 9-12. This research is already making an
                   impact on cell biology. It has led to the realization
                   that the architectural features of molecular
                   interaction networks within a cell are shared to a
                   large degree by other complex systems, such as the
                   Internet, computer chips and society. This unexpected
                   universality indicates that similar laws may govern
                   most complex networks in nature, which allows the
                   expertise from large and well-mapped non-biological
                   systems to be used to characterize the intricate
                   interwoven relationships that govern cellular
                   functions. In this review, we show that the
                   quantifiable tools of network theory offer unforeseen
                   possibilities to understand the cell's internal
                   organization and evolution, fundamentally altering
                   our view of cell biology. The emerging results are
                   forcing the realization that, notwithstanding the
                   importance of individual molecules, cellular function
                   is a contextual attribute of strict and quantifiable
                   patterns of interactions between the myriad of
                   cellular constituents. Although uncovering the
                   generic organizing principles of cellular networks A
                   key aim of postgenomic biomedical research is to
                   systematically catalogue all molecules and their
                   interactions within a living cell. There is a clear
                   need to understand how these molecules and the
                   interactions between them determine the function of
                   this enormously complex machinery, both in isolation
                   and when surrounded by other cells. Rapid advances in
                   network biology indicate that cellular networks are
                   governed by universal laws and offer a new conceptual
                   framework that could potentially revolutionize our
                   view of biology and disease pathologies in the
                   twenty-first century. PROTEIN CHIPS Similar to cDNA
                   microarrays, this evolving technology involves
                   arraying a genomic set of proteins on a solid surface
                   without denaturing them. The proteins are arrayed at
                   a high enough density for the detection of activity,
                   binding to lipids and so on.},

                   synthetic molecules has historically not received
                   much attention from chemists, even though research
                   into complexity is well established in the
                   neighbouring fields. However, with the huge recent
                   interest in systems biology and the availability of
                   modern analytical techniques this situation is likely
                   to change. In this tutorial review we discuss some of
                   the incentives for developing systems chemistry and
                   we highlight the pioneering work in which molecular
                   networks are making a splash. A distinction is made
                   between networks under thermodynamic and kinetic
                   control. The former include dynamic combinatorial
                   libraries while the latter involve pseudo-dynamic
                   combinatorial libraries, oscillating reactions and
                   networks of autocatalytic and replicating compounds.
                   These studies provide fundamental insights into the
                   organisational principles of molecular networks and
                   how these give rise to emergent properties such as
                   amplification and feedback loops, and may eventually
                   shed light on the origin of life. The knowledge

                   model contains many parameters. Typically, algorithms
                   get lost in regions of parameter space in which the
                   model is unresponsive to changes in parameters, and
                   one is left to make adjustments by hand. We explain
                   this difficulty by interpreting the fitting process
                   as a generalized interpolation procedure. By
                   considering the manifold of all model predictions in
                   data space, we find that cross sections have a
                   hierarchy of widths and are typically very narrow.
                   Algorithms become stuck as they move near the
                   boundaries. We observe that the model manifold, in
                   addition to being tightly bounded, has low extrinsic
                   curvature, leading to the use of geodesics in the
                   fitting process. We improve the convergence of the
                   Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm by adding geodesic
                   acceleration to the usual step.},

                   accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model using the
                   log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations
                   of the parameter values. LOO and WAIC have various
                   advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error
                   such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice
                   because they involve additional computational steps.
                   Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO
                   and WAIC that can be performed using existing
                   simulation draws. We introduce an efficient
                   computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance
                   sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing
                   importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically
                   equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more
                   robust in the finite case with weak priors or
                   influential observations. As a byproduct of our
                   calculations, we also obtain approximate standard
                   errors for estimated predictive errors and for
                   comparison of predictive errors between two models.

                   loo and demonstrate using models fit with the

                   growth of Bayesian statistics as it is applied to

                   sparse beginnings, where Bayesian statistics was
                   barely mentioned, Bayesian statistics has now
                   permeated all the major areas of medical statistics,

  year =          {2017},
  abstract =      {Examining enzyme kinetics is critical for
                   understanding cellular systems and for using enzymes
                   in industry. The Michaelis-Menten equation has been
                   widely used for over a century to estimate the enzyme
                   kinetic parameters from reaction progress curves of
                   substrates, which is known as the progress curve
                   assay. However, this canonical approach works in
                   limited conditions, such as when there is a large
                   excess of substrate over enzyme. Even when this
                   condition is satisfied, the identifiability of
                   parameters is not always guaranteed, and often not
                   verifiable in practice. To overcome such limitations
                   of the canonical approach for the progress curve
                   assay, here we propose a Bayesian approach based on
                   an equation derived with the total quasi-steady-state
                   approximation. In contrast to the canonical approach,
                   estimates obtained with this proposed approach
                   exhibit little bias for any combination of enzyme and
                   substrate concentrations. Importantly, unlike the
                   canonical approach, an optimal experiment to identify
                   parameters with certainty can be easily designed
                   without any prior information. Indeed, with this
                   proposed design, the kinetic parameters of diverse
                   enzymes with disparate catalytic efficiencies, such
                   as chymotrypsin, fumarase, and urease, can be
                   accurately and precisely estimated from a minimal
                   amount of timecourse data. A publicly accessible
                   computational package performing such accurate and
                   efficient Bayesian inference for enzyme kinetics is
                   provided. Because enzymes can modulate biochemical
                   reaction rates by selectively catalyzing specific
                   substrates 1 , they play fundamental roles in
                   metabolism, signal transduction, and cell regulation,
                   and their malfunction can cause serious diseases 2,3.
                   Furthermore, enzymes have been used as extremely
                   specific catalysts in diverse industrial fields such
                   as drug development, biofuel production, and food
                   processing 4. A canonical approach used to understand
                   enzyme kinetics for a century has been based on the
                   Michaelis-Menten equation (MM equation), which was
                   developed by Michaelis and Menten 5 and then was more
                   rigorously derived by Briggs and Haldane 6 using the
                   standard quasi-steady-state approximation (sQSSA) 7.
                   The equation describes the dependence of
                   enzyme-catalyzed reaction rates on the concentration
                   of substrate by using two parameters, the catalytic
                   constant, k cat and the Michaelis-Menten constant, K
                   M (see below for details). The k cat determines the
                   maximum rate of the reaction at saturating substrate
                   concentrations, V max = k cat E T , where E T is
                   total enzyme concentration, and the K M is the
                   substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is
                   half of V max. There are two major assays to estimate
                   k cat and K M from a measured accumulation of product
                   over time (i.e. progress curve): the initial velocity
                   assay (initial rate analysis) and the reaction
                   progress curve assay (progress curve analysis) 8-12.
                   For the initial velocity assay, initial rates of the
                   reaction are measured for a range of substrate
                   concentrations. Then, by using a linear transform of
                   these data, such as Lineweaver-Burk plots, the two
                   parameters can be easily estimated without use of any
                   computational tools 8,9. Recent advances in
                   computational tools have led to an alternative
                   approach: the reaction progress curve assay. In this
                   assay, the entire timecourse (i.e. progress curve) is
                   fitted to the solution of a differential equation or
                   integrated rate equation, and thus the data},

                   specificity of cellular responses to receptor
                   stimulation is encoded by the spatial and temporal
                   dynamics of downstream signalling networks. Temporal
                   dynamics are coupled to spatial gradients of
                   signalling activities, which guide pivotal
                   intracellular processes and tightly regulate signal
                   propagation across a cell. Computational models
                   provide insights into the complex relationships
                   between the stimuli and the cellular responses, and
                   reveal the mechanisms that are responsible for signal
                   amplification, noise reduction and generation of
                   discontinuous bistable dynamics or oscillations.
                   Cells respond to external cues using a limited number
                   of signalling pathways that are activated by
                   plasma-membrane receptors, such as G protein-coupled
                   receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases
                   (RTKs). These pathways do not simply transmit, but
                   they also process, encode and integrate internal and
                   external signals. Recently, it has become apparent
                   that distinct spatio-temporal activation profiles of
                   the same repertoire of signalling proteins result in
                   different gene-expression patterns and diverse
                   physiological responses 1-3. These observations
                   indicate that pivotal cellular decisions, such as
                   cytoskeletal reorganization, cell-cycle checkpoints
                   and cell death (apoptosis), depend on the precise
                   temporal control and relative spatial distribution of
                   activated signal transducers. RTK-mediated signalling
                   pathways have been in the limelight of scientific
                   interest owing to their central role in the
                   regulation of embryogenesis, cell survival, motility,
                   proliferation, differentiation, glucose metabolism
                   and apoptosis 4-6. Malfunction of RTK signalling is a
                   leading cause of important human diseases that range
                   from developmental defects to cancer, chronic
                   inflammatory syndromes and diabetes 6-8. Upon
                   stimulation, RTKs undergo dimerization (for example ,
                   the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)) or
                   allosteric transitions (insulin receptor) that result
                   in the activation of the intrinsic tyrosine-kinase
                   activity 4,9. Subsequent phosphorylation of multiple
                   tyrosine residues on the receptor transmits a
                   biochemical signal to numerous cytoplasmic proteins,
                   thereby triggering their mobilization to the cell
                   surface 4,10. The resulting cellular responses occur
                   through complex biochemical circuits of
                   protein-protein interactions and
                   covalent-modification cascades. An emerging picture
                   of interconnected signalling networks has replaced
                   the earlier concepts of discrete linear pathways,
                   which relate extracellular signals to the expression
                   of specific genes, raising questions about the
                   specificity of signal-response events. In fact, the
                   protein complement that mediates signal transduction
                   downstream of RTKs is similar for all the
                   RTK-mediated pathways 11. Both GPCRs and RTKs
                   activate kinase and phosphatase cascades, such as
                   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades,
                   that induce the expression of nuclear transcription
                   factors. For any individual receptor pathway, there
                   is no single protein or gene that is responsible for
                   signalling specificity. Instead, specificity is
                   determined by the temporal and spatial dynamics of
                   downstream signalling components. A classical example
                   is the distinct biological outcome of the PC12
                   cell-line stimulation with EGF and nerve growth
                   factor (NGF). EGF induces transient MAPK activation,
                   which results in cell proliferation, whereas a
                   sustained MAPK activation by NGF changes the cell
                   fate and induces cell differentiation 1,2. However,
                   the factors that control the kinetics of MAPK
                   cascades are intricate. MAPK cascades can generate
                   bistable dynamics (in which two stable 'on' and 'off
                   ' steady states coexist), abrupt switches and

  abstract =      {As modeling becomes a more widespread practice in the
                   life sciences and biomedical sciences, researchers
                   need reliable tools to calibrate models against ever
                   more complex and detailed data. Here we present an
                   approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework and
                   software environment, ABC-SysBio, which is a Python
                   package that runs on Linux and Mac OS X systems and
                   that enables parameter estimation and model selection
                   in the Bayesian formalism by using sequential Monte
                   Carlo (SMC) approaches. We outline the underlying
                   rationale, discuss the computational and practical
                   issues and provide detailed guidance as to how the
                   important tasks of parameter inference and model
                   selection can be performed in practice. Unlike other
                   available packages, ABC-SysBio is highly suited for
                   investigating, in particular, the challenging problem
                   of fitting stochastic models to data. In order to
                   demonstrate the use of ABC-SysBio, in this protocol
                   we postulate the existence of an imaginary reaction
                   network composed of seven interrelated biological
                   reactions (involving a specific mRNA, the protein it
                   encodes and a post-translationally modified version
                   of the protein), a network that is defined by two
                   files containing 'observed' data that we provide as
                   supplementary information. In the first part of the
                   PROCEDURE, ABC-SysBio is used to infer the parameters
                   of this system, whereas in the second part we use
                   ABC-SysBio's relevant functionality to discriminate
                   between two different reaction network models, one of
                   them being the 'true' one. Although computationally
                   expensive, the additional insights gained in the
                   Bayesian formalism more than make up for this cost,
                   especially in complex problems. {\textcopyright} 2014

                   interventions can influence multiple sites in
                   metabolic pathways, and often these are 'distant'
                   from the primary effect. In this regard, the ability
                   to identify target and off-target effects of a
                   specific compound or gene therapy is both a major
                   challenge and critical in drug discovery. Results: We
                   applied Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for parameter
                   estimation and perturbation identification in the
                   kinetic modeling of metabolic pathways. Variability
                   in the steady-state measurements in cells taken from
                   a population can be caused by differences in initial
                   conditions within the population, by variation of
                   parameters among individuals and by possible
                   measurement noise. MCMC-based parameter estimation is
                   proposed as a method to help in inferring parameter
                   distributions, taking into account uncertainties in
                   the initial conditions and in the measurement data.
                   The inferred parameter distributions are then used to
                   predict changes in the network via a simple
                   classification method. The proposed technique is
                   applied to analyze changes in the pathways of
                   pyruvate metabolism of mutants of Lactococcus lactis,
                   based on previously published experimental data.

                   metabolite and protein concentrations that can be
                   used to help inform new strain designs. However,
                   integrating these data sources to generate
                   predictions of steady-state metabolism typically
                   requires a kinetic description of the enzymatic
                   reactions that occur within a cell. Parameterizing
                   these kinetic models from biological data can be
                   computationally difficult, especially as the amount
                   of data increases. Robust methods must also be able
                   to quantify the uncertainty in model parameters as a
                   function of the available data, which can be
                   particularly computationally intensive. The field of
                   Bayesian inference offers a wide range of methods for
                   estimating distributions in parameter uncertainty.
                   However, these techniques are poorly suited to
                   kinetic metabolic modeling due to the complex kinetic
                   rate laws typically employed and the resulting
                   dynamic system that must be solved. In this paper, we
                   employ linear-logarithmic kinetics to simplify the
                   calculation of steady-state flux distributions and
                   enable efficient sampling and variational inference

                   the posterior distribution of kinetic model
                   parameters can be obtained efficiently at a variety
                   of different problem scales, including large-scale
                   kinetic models trained on multiomics datasets. These
                   results allow modern Bayesian machine learning tools

  abstract =      {Bayesian statistics is an approach to data analysis
                   and parameter estimation based on Bayes' theorem.
                   Unique for Bayesian statistics is that all observed
                   and unob-served parameters in a statistical model are
                   given a joint probability distribution, termed the
                   prior and data distributions. The typical Bayesian
                   workflow consists of three main steps (Fig. 1):
                   capturing available knowledge about a given parameter
                   in a statistical model via the prior distribution,
                   which is typically determined before data collection;
                   determining the likelihood function using the
                   information about the parameters available in the
                   observed data; and combining both the prior
                   distribution and the likelihood function using Bayes'
                   theorem in the form of the posterior distribution.
                   The posterior distribution reflects one's updated
                   knowledge, balancing prior knowledge with observed
                   data, and is used to conduct inferences. Bayesian
                   inferences are optimal when averaged over this joint
                   probability distribution and inference for these
                   quantities is based on their conditional distribution
                   given the observed data. The basis of Bayesian
                   statistics was first described in a 1763 essay
                   written by Reverend Thomas Bayes and published by
                   Richard Price 1 on inverse probability, or how to
                   determine the probability of a future event solely
                   based on past events. It was not until 1825 that
                   Pierre Simon Laplace 2 published the theorem we now
                   know as Bayes' theorem (Box 1). Although the ideas of
                   inverse probability and Bayes' theorem are
                   longstanding in mathematics, these tools became
                   prominent in applied statistics in the past 50 years
                   3-10. We describe many advantages and disadvantages
                   throughout the Primer. This Primer provides an
                   overview of the current and future use of Bayesian
                   statistics that is suitable for quantitative
                   researchers working across a broad range of
                   science-related areas that have at least some
                   knowledge of regression modelling. We supply an
                   overview of the literature that can be used for
                   further study and illustrate how to implement a
                   Bayesian model on real data. All of the data and code
                   are available for teaching purposes. This Primer
                   discusses the general framework of Bayesian
                   statistics and introduces a Bayesian research cycle
                   (Fig. 1). We first discuss formalizing of prior
                   distributions , prior predictive checking and
                   determining the likelihood distribution
                   (Experimentation). We discuss relevant algorithms and
                   model fitting, describe examples of variable
                   selection and variational inference , and provide an
                   example calculation with posterior predictive
                   checking (Results). Then, we describe how Bayesian
                   statistics are being used in different fields of
                   science (Applications), followed by guidelines for
                   data sharing, reproducibility and reporting standards
                   (Reproducibility and data deposition). We conclude
                   with a discussion on avoiding bias introduced by
                   using incorrect models (Limitations and
                   optimizations), and provide a look into the future
                   with Bayesian artificial intelligence (Outlook).
                   Abstract | Bayesian statistics is an approach to data
                   analysis based on Bayes' theorem, where available
                   knowledge about parameters in a statistical model is
                   updated with the information in observed data. The
                   background knowledge is expressed as a prior
                   distribution and combined with observational data in
                   the form of a likelihood function to determine the
                   posterior distribution. The posterior can also be
                   used for making predictions about future events. This
                   Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian
                   analysis, from specifying the prior and data models
                   to deriving inference, model checking and refinement.
                   We discuss the importance of prior and posterior
                   predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for
                   sampling from a posterior distribution, variational
                   inference and variable selection. Examples of
                   successful applications of Bayesian analysis across
                   various research fields are provided, including in
                   social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and
                   more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and
                   reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when
                   to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian
                   Statistics) checklist. Finally, we outline the impact
                   of Bayesian analysis on artificial intelligence, a
                   major goal in the next decade. ✉},

                   basic units of synthetic systems with autonomous,
                   adaptive and programmable behaviours. Activation and
                   inhibition have been usually considered as
                   indispensable interactions for the construction of
                   such networks. Here we present an enzymatic reaction
                   network that consists of a flavin adenine
                   dinucleotide-dependent oxidoreductase and a
                   peroxidase that can generate tunable complex
                   dynamics. These include charging/discharging,
                   rectangular and parabolic pulses in a closed system,
                   which are based on delayed and self-adapting
                   substrate competition, rather than on activation or
                   inhibition. Additionally, this system can
                   spontaneously form visible spatiotemporal patterns
                   that arise from reaction-driven Rayleigh-Bénard
                   convection. This work demonstrates that substrate
                   competition could be an alternative path towards
                   constructing biochemical networks with complex
                   dynamics.},

                   biochemical reaction networks. The design and
                   construction of synthetic reaction networks
                   exhibiting ultrasensitivity has been challenging, but
                   would greatly expand the potential properties of
                   life-like materials. Herein, we exploit a general and
                   modular strategy to reversibly regulate the activity
                   of enzymes using light and show how ultrasensitivity
                   arises in simple out-of-equilibrium enzymatic systems
                   upon incorporation of reversible photoswitchable
                   inhibitors (PIs). Utilizing a chromophore/warhead
                   strategy, PIs of the protease a-chymotrypsin were
                   synthesized, which led to the discovery of inhibitors
                   with large differences in inhibition constants (Ki)
                   for the different photoisomers. A microfluidic flow
                   setup was used to study enzymatic reactions under
                   out-of-equilibrium conditions by continuous addition
                   and removal of reagents. Upon irradiation of the
                   continuously stirred tank reactor with different
                   light pulse sequences, i.e., varying the pulse
                   duration or frequency of UV and blue light
                   irradiation, reversible switching between
                   photoisomers resulted in ultrasensitive responses in
                   enzymatic activity as well as frequency filtering of
                   input signals. This general and modular strategy
                   enables reversible and tunable control over the
                   kinetic rates of individual enzyme-catalyzed
                   reactions and makes a programmable linkage of enzymes
                   to a wide range of network topologies feasible.},

  abstract =      {A new method for peak detection in two-dimensional
                   chromatography is presented. In a first step, the
                   method starts with a conventional one-dimensional
                   peak detection algorithm to detect modulated peaks.
                   In a second step, a sophisticated algorithm is
                   constructed to decide which of the individual
                   one-dimensional peaks have been originated from the
                   same compound and should then be arranged in a
                   two-dimensional peak. The merging algorithm is based
                   on Bayesian inference. The user sets prior
                   information about certain parameters (e.g.,
                   second-dimension retention time variability,
                   first-dimension band broadening, chromatographic
                   noise). On the basis of these priors, the algorithm
                   calculates the probability of myriads of peak
                   arrangements (i.e., ways of merging one-dimensional
                   peaks), finding which of them holds the highest
                   value. Uncertainty in each parameter can be accounted
                   by adapting conveniently its probability distribution
                   function, which in turn may change the final decision
                   of the most probable peak arrangement. It has been
                   demonstrated that the Bayesian approach presented in
                   this paper follows the chromatographers’ intuition.
                   The algorithm has been applied and tested with LC ×
                   LC and GC × GC data and takes around 1 min to
                   process chromatograms with several thousands of
                   peaks.},

                   and computational functions under controlled

                   enzymatically driven DNA-based networks to downstream

                   feedback-controlled DNA-circuits capable of advanced

                   network to unique DNA strands driving downstream
                   actuators with minimal retroactivity and support
